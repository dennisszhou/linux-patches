Subject: [PATCH 0/1] btrfs: compressed writeback cgroup attribution

Hello,

I was looking at some blk-cgroup attribution stuff due to an ask
regarding io_uring and was thinking back to this work. I noticed that
the cgroup attribution for writeback is gone. Josef or Chris, can you
comment if this is still desired / the state of REQ_CGROUP_PUNT?

Thanks,
Dennis
