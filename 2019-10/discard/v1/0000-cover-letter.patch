Subject: [RFC PATCH 00/19] btrfs: async discard support

Hello,

Discard is an operation that allows for the filesystem to communicate
with underlying ssds that a lba region is no longer needed. This gives
the drive the more information as it tries to manage the available free
space to minimize write amplification. However, discard hasn't been
given the most tlc. Discard is a problematic command because a drive's
physical block management is more or less a black box to us and the
effects of any particular discard aren't necessarily limited the
lifetime of a command.

Currently, btrfs handles discarding synchronously during transaction
commit. This problematically can delay transaction commit based on the
amount of space that needs to be trimmed and the efficacy of the discard
operation for a particular drive.

This series introduces async discarding, which removes discard from the
transaction commit path. While every SSD has the choice of implementing
trim support different, we strive here to do the right thing. The idea
hinges on recognizing that write amplification really only kicks in once
we're really low on free space.  As long as we trim enough to keep a
large enough pool of free space, in theory this should minimize the cost
of issuing discards on a workload and have limited cost overhead in
write amplification.

With async discard, we try to emphasize discarding larger regions
and reusing the lba (implicit discard). The first is done by using the
free space cache to maintain discard state and thus allows us to get
coalescing for fairly cheap. A background workqueue is used to scan over
an LRU kept list of the block groups. It then uses filters to determine
what to discard next hence giving priority to larger discards. While
reusing an lba isn't explicitly attempted, it happens implicitly via
find_free_extent() which if it happens to find a dirty extent, will
grant us reuse of the lba. Additionally, async discarding skips metadata
block groups as these should see a fairly high turnover as btrfs is a
self-packing filesystem being stingy with allocating new block groups
until necessary.

Preliminary results seem promising as when a lot of freeing is going on,
the discarding is delayed allowing for reuse which translates to less
discarding (in addition to the slower discarding). This has shown a
reduction in p90 and p99 read latencies on a test on our webservers.

I am currently working on tuning the rate at which it discards in the
background. I am doing this by evaluating other workloads and drives.
The iops and bps rate limits are fairly aggressive right now as my
basic survey of a few drives noted that the trim command itself is a
significant part of the overhead. So optimizing for larger trims is the
right thing to do.

Persistence isn't supported, so when we mount a filesystem, the block
groups are read in as dirty and background trim begins. This makes async
discard more useful for longer running mount points.

0001 exports percpu's bitmap iterators for eventual use in 0015. 0002
renames DISCARD to DISCARD_SYNC. 0003 and 0004 adds discard tracking to
the free space cache. 0005-0007 adds the core of async discard support.
0008-0013 fiddle with stats and operation limits. 0014 makes async
discarding only track data block groups. 0015 loads block groups on
reading in the block groups. 0016 adds reuse stats. 0017 adds an
explanation header. 0018 and 0019 modify the free space cache metadata
allowance, add a bitmap -> extent path and makes us more likely to put
smaller extents into the bitmaps.
