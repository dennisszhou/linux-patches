Subject: [PATCH v5 00/22] btrfs: async discard support

Hello,

Dave reported that with async discard enabled, relocation fails [1].
This could be caused by two things. First, if we unpin extents, that
means we haven't fully discarded the block group and need to let async
discard revisit it. Second, relocation removes block_groups outside of
the normal. I fixed both issues and now it successfully passes xfstests
btrfs/003.

Changes in v5:
 - Changed the rules so free space is always added as the right type
   based on discard settings (see btrfs_add_free_space()), this removes
   the need to pass around trim_state in unpin_extent_range().
 - Handled relocation block group deletion (xfstests btrfs/003)
 - When adding to the discard lists, make sure the work queue is active.
   (made all additions go through either btrfs_discard_queue_work() or
   btrfs_discard_check_filter()).
 - Added 10 sec reuse timeout for fully empty block groups.

v4 is available here: [2].

This series is on top of btrfs-devel#misc-next fbc0468e42d2 + [3].
