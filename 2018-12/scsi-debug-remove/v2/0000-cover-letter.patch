Subject: [PATCH blktests v2 0/2] Add scsi-stress-remove to blktests

Hi,

v2:
There was a minor typo in 0001 pointed out by Omar which I fixed here.
0002 was refactored to use common/scsi_debug. I also rebased onto the
top of osandov#josef changing the test from block/022 -> block/027.

From v1:
Ming Lei's scsi-stress-remove test found a bug in blkg destruction [1]
where bios being created when the request_queue was being cleaned up
threw a NPE in blkg association. The fix is currently being discussed in
[2]. To make this test more accessible, I've ported it to blktests with
Ming Lei's copyright. I've tested this in my qemu instance and verified
we do not see the NPE on a fixed kernel.

Ming, please let me know if you have any objections.
