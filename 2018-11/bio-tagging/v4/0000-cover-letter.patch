Subject: [PATCH 00/13 v4] block: always associate blkg and refcount cleanup

Hi everyone,

This is respin of v3 [1] with fixes for the errors reported in [2] and
[3]. v3 was reverted in [4].

The issue in [3] was that bio->bi_disk->queue and blkg->q were out
of sync. So when I changed blk_get_rl() to use blkg->q, the wrong queue
was returned and elevator from q->elevator->type threw a NPE. Note, with
v4.21, the old block stack was removed and so this patch was dropped. I
did backport this to v4.20 and verified this series does not encounter
the error.

The biggest changes in v4 are when association occurs and clearly
defining the cases where association should happen.
  1. Association is now done when the device is set to keep blkg->q and
     bio->bi_disk->queue in sync.
  2. When a bio is submitted directly to the device, it will not be
     associated with a blkg. This is because a blkg represents the
     relationship between a blkcg and a request_queue. Going directly to
     the device means the request_queue may not exist meaning no blkg
     will exist.

The patch updating blk_get_rl() was dropped (v3 10/12). The patch to
always associate a blkg from v3 (v3 04/12) was fixed and split into
patches 0004 and 0005. 0011 is new removing bio_disassociate_task().

Summarizing the ideas of this series:
  1. Gracefully handle blkg failure to create by walking up the blkg
     tree rather than fall through to root.
  2. Associate a bio with a blkg in core logic rather than per
     controller logic.
  3. Rather than have a css and blkg reference, hold just a blkg ref
     as it also holds a css ref.
  4. Switch to percpu ref counting for blkg.
